/*
Given an array arr[] containing N integers. In one step, any element of the array can either be increased or decreased by one. Find minimum steps required such that the product of the array elements becomes 1.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-2, 4, 0}
Output:
5
Explanation:
We can change -2 to -1, 0 to -1 and 4 to 1.
So, a total of 5 steps are required
to update the elements such that
the product of the final array is 1. 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-1, 1, -1} 
Output :
0
Explanation:
Product of the array is already 1.
So, we don't need to change anything.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function makeProductOne() which takes an integer N and an array arr of size N as input and returns the minimum steps required.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
-10^3 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3
